## Descriptions
---
I created this app to allow business owners the ability to view and manage their departments, roles, and employees in their company to help with organization and planning for their business. This app does everything for the owner, and all they have to do is answer questions. Based on their choices and answers they will be able to view their departments, roles, employees/employees by department/employees by manager, the total utilized budget of a department, or add/remove/update any department, role, or employee. I learned how quickly a simple change can be when you have the foundational functions done for you. A business owner can easily update their tables instead of having to scroll to find a particular department, role, or employee and then make the changes.

## Complications
---
Getting started was hard at first because I was trying to work on the function for viewing all employees, but I did not have any values in the tables to utilize. Once I realized that I needed to include fake deparments, roles, and employees it began to fall into place. 
Creating the correct SELECT by JOINING all three tables was difficult at first. It took a lot of researching, but I finally found that some of the column names needed to be set AS what they were and that I then could use those names when joining the tables. This is something I will need to continue using in the future to strengthen this skill.
In one function I had placed the inquirer in the wrong location and couldn't figure out why an array was coming back undefined. I tried to get some help, and the person was unable to help me figure it out. I decided to try to move in in the first db.query right after the err part and this solved the problem. 
## Features
---
In the future I would like to include an extra option where the business owner can view a specific employee.
